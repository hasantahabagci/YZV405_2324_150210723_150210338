# Natural Language Processing Term Project (On Dev!)

This repository contains the code and documentation for our term project in the course titled "Natural Language Processing". Our project focuses on the diacritization of the Turkish language.

## Introduction
In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), diacritization is a challenging task that involves adding diacritical marks to letters, which significantly impacts the meaning, pronunciation, and grammatical context of words in many languages. Our work explores innovative approaches to tackle the diacritization problem, particularly focusing on the Turkish language.


## Problem and Dataset
The diacritization of Turkish presents unique challenges due to the significant impact of diacritics on the semantic content of words. Our dataset comprises a collection of undiacritized Turkish text, posing challenges in identifying and correcting diacritic and character errors while preserving the intended meaning of words.

## Literature Review
We conducted a literature review on deep learning approaches to diacritization, focusing on key developments and findings in the field. Our review covers Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models, attention mechanisms, character-level vs. word-level prediction techniques, and the integration of language-specific knowledge into diacritization models.

## Potential Solutions
### Data Augmentation
We propose introducing controlled alterations to the dataset through random character substitution to simulate linguistic variations and improve model generalization.

### Model Architecture
Coming soon..!
